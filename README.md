# MERN-News-Scraper

Full stack web scraping application using MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js. This app scrapes www.AZCentral.com and stores news articles into a Mongo Database.

This project is a current work in progress, yet my favorite application. It is not currently deployed anywhere, but will be deployed on heroku soon, for anyone to use. The goal of this project was to recreate the AZ Central website to view all articles in a list instead of having to navigate throughout the whole site and different routes. 

This app has pushed my knowledge of Javascript, React, and Backend Servers and Databases to a whole new level. I am excited to see where this project goes, I hope you enjoy.
